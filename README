This is a program to replicate the results in the biofilm_threshold_theory paper, aiming to compare the stochastic version to the
deterministic one.

We'll set K = 1000 and keep g_max at 0.083, then vary the other parameters according to the ratios mentioned in Figure 4.

There is no uniform death rate in these simulations presently
